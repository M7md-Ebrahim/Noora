# What is Noora

After years of building a CLI in Swift—[Tuist](https://github.com/tuist/tuist)—and observing utility ecosystems in other programming languages (e.g., [Charm](https://github.com/charmbracelet)), we realized the Swift ecosystem lacked foundational utilities to elevate CLI experiences.

**Noora** is our response.
It distills common CLI patterns into a cohesive design system of themable components, enabling richer and more interactive experiences. While the project is still a work in progress, we plan to continually expand it by identifying and extracting patterns from our work on Tuist.

The [project](https://github.com/tuist/tuist) is open source, licensed under MIT, and we warmly welcome community contributions.
